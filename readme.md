CS1699 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing and Code Coverage

We chose to test this project because it was code that had been written previously for a class that we both have taken. The fact that the program and data structures deal with strings, nodes, and linked lists gave us a good amount of code to cover.

*insert description of the objects we tested, what they do*

*description of issues faced when writing these tests*
*issues expected going forward based on experiences*
*detail all failing tests in concerns section*

*note where the code is located*

Code Coverage

To determine the code coverage of our tests, we used the code coverage analysis tool that is included with the IntelliJ IDEA.

Here is the table from the screenshot:

|	Element |Class % | Method %  | Line %  |
|---------------|--------|-----------|---------|
|	     DLB|   100% | 	43%  |   55%   |
|        DLBTest|   100% | 	100% |   84%   |
|     LinkedList|   100% |      100% |   93%   |
| LinkedListTest|   100% |      100% |   93%   |
|   MyDictionary|   100% |      75%  |   48%   |
|   	    Node|   100% |      80%  |   86%   |
