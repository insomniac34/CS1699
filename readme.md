CS1699 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing and Code Coverage

We chose to test this project because it was code that had been written previously for a class that we both have taken. The fact that the program and data structures deal with strings, nodes, and linked lists gave us a good amount of code to cover.

*insert description of the objects we tested, what they do*

*description of issues faced when writing these tests*
*issues expected going forward based on experiences*
*detail all failing tests in concerns section*

*note where the code is located*
